	<p> Description: Giraffes are the worlds tallest mammals. They are uniquely adapted to reach vegetation inaccessible to other herbivores. The giraffe has unusually elastic blood vessels with a series of valves that help offset the sudden buildup of blood (and to prevent fainting) when its head is raised, lowered, or swung quickly. Giraffe "horns" are actually knobs covered with skin and hair above the eyes that protect the head from injury. </p>
